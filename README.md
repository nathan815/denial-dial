# Denial Dial 

Denial Dial is a new spin on the "rejection hotline".

Is someone bothering you for your number and won't go away? Give them this phone number!

What will happen?

1) If/when they text the number, it will message them back after a delay
2) They will be randomly paired with another "rejected" person who also texted this number. At this point, they'll be _unknowlingly messaging each other_.
3) After a few messages are sent, it will call both of them and announce they were given the rejection hotline.
